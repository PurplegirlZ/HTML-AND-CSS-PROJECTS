			<h1>Kingdom Hearts</h1>
			<p>Kingdom Hearts is one of my favorite games. I enjoy playing in all the different disney worlds and everything you can find there, from the bosses to the secrets, I love it all. This is a website of everything I can think of about this game, maybe it will interest others and get them as invested as I am. I will be going over different worlds, story beats, and heartless you can find in these worlds. This will all be mostly my own knowledge though so some stuff might be wrong or not very in depth and also different then the original PS2 game since I am working with the PC, HD 1.5 remix version. This is also my first website and it is being expanded as I take a class so it may look messy.</p>
			<p>The order of the worlds I talk about here will be in the order of the journals "Chronicals" section for the main worlds. For ones not included I will put them in the spots they go in for story starting with-</p>

		<h3>Halloween Town</h3>
		<p>The world of "Nightmare before Christmas" is my favorite in both the first and second games. I really enjoy the costume designs and this world feels the most lively to me compared to the others. I like how it has a different story then the plot of the original movie and it actually feels unigue.</p>
		<p>Sadly this world does not come back in Kingdom Hearts 3. I would've really liked to see it in the upgraded graphics.</p>

		<h3>The Hundred Acre Woods</h3>
		<p>This is the "Winnie the Pooh" world, but really it's a book you jump into. You get to help Pooh bear in many fun minigames and help get the pages of the book. You get to see all the friends and it's heartwarming just in the real series. I always wanted to be best friends with Pooh.</p>
		<p>Unlike Halloween Town, this one returns in the 3rd game. But sadly I can not fully remember what happens in it since I have not played the third game since 2019 thanks to my Xbox breaking but it is in the lineup since I just recently bought all the Kingdom Hearts games for pc! (If only they would stop crashing though....)</p>
		<h6>Dalmation puppies</h6>
		<p>Also as you go through the game you will also find dalmation pups (from 101 Dalmations) in chest. You can find up to 99 of them in the game and you get items for finding them. As you find them, you can watch the dalmation house fill up with puppies and in one of the rooms one of the puppies even follows you already slowly. They are quite cute and I love them.
