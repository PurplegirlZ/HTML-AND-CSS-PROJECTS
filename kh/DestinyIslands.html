				Destiny islands is the first area of the game and the world <a href="Sora.html">Sora</a> and his friends call home. He doesn't actually live on the island you start on though, he lives on one close by you don't see until Kingdom&nbsp;Hearts&nbsp;II.<br>

				When you first start the game Sora and his friends, <a href="Assignment.html">Riku</a> and <a href="Assignment.html">Kairi</a>, are planning to build a raft to get off the island. They have you collect items strewed about the island. During this you can take time to talk to others on the island and battle them. <br>

			There are 4 different people on the island you can battle. Selphie, Tidus, and Wakka are the easier of the ones you fight. They originate from Final Fantasy.<br>
				<span style="color:yellow;">Selphie is a girl from the island that you don't see for the rest of the game, she sits at the end of the dock and when you ask to fight her she will attack Sora with her jumprope. She is quite easy to beat if you just keep hitting her.</span><br>
				<span style="color:red;">Tidus is also from the islands but when the island is destroyed you can find him at Travese Town, where he is worrying about his parents. He fights with a stick and is a little harder to beat then Selphie but not very.</span><br>
				<span style="color:blue;">Wakka is annoying. He fights you with a ball that he throws at your head and if you try to play by his game and hit it back at him 9/10 times you will just either miss the ball and get hit or it will go over him without hitting him. My suggestion? Pummel him, dodge when he goes to swing at you then just go back at wacking him close range.</span><br>
				The 4th person you can battle is Riku, who in my opinion, is the toughest of them all. He fights you with the same weapon Sora has, a wooden sword. When you fight him after 4 hits he will curl up and kick you hard, so you need to make sure your forth hit isn't a end combo or you are getting kicked no matter what. He also has more health then the others so watch out.
