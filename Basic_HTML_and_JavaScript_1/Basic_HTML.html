<p>"That guy is loud.."</p>
<p>&rpar;Ignore all of this one I am going insane from all this being weird&lpar;My htmls got all mixed up I think this is my original one though, the website keeps telling me to do things that don't exist, there is no show panel button in my appearence and stuff looks different in some parts of the website. also I have no idea what it wants me to do for this pull reguest thing since it keeping saying there is nothing different from this one but the title and placement of this file is different in the main but it keeps telling me it's not and I don't even know what to look up to fix this.</p>
